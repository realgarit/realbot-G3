# 🚲 Acro Bike Bunny Hop

This mode makes the bot bunny hop in place using the [Acro Bike](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Acro_Bike). 

It's really useful for hunting in the Safari Zone or using the [repel trick](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Repel_trick) because bunny hopping doesn't count as taking steps. This means your Safrai time won't run out and your Repels will last forever.

## How to use it
1. Register the Acro Bike to your Select button.
2. Go to a patch of grass or a cave where you want to hunt.
3. Start the bot on your GBA.

**Note**: Bunny hopping is usually a bit slower than [spinning](Mode%20-%20Spin.md).

## Safari Zone Strategy (R/S/E)
For the Hoenn games, the bot uses a smart strategy to catch Pokémon. It calculates the best moves based on your Pokéblocks and whether you should throw a ball or use food. If you don't have any Pokéblocks, it will just keep throwing balls until it catches the Pokémon.
