# 🍓 Berry Blender

This mode plays the Berry Blender minigame perfectly every time. 

## How to use it
1. Find a Berry Blender table that has 1 to 3 NPCs already standing there. (The empty tables are only for multiplayer, and the bot won't work there.)
2. Stand right in front of the table.
3. Start the bot.

**Tip**: Go into your game settings and turn on **L=A**. This lets the bot hit the buttons faster, which helps it get a better score.
