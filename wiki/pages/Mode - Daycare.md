# 🥚 Daycare

This mode automates breeding and hatching eggs. It will collect up to five eggs, hatch them, and then release them if they aren't shiny.

## What You'll Need
- A pair of Pokémon that can breed already in the Daycare.

### Helpful Tips
- **Flame Body or Magma Armor**: In Emerald, having a Pokémon with one of these abilities in your party will cut the hatching time in half.
- **Bicycle**: Register your bike to the `Select` button so the bot can move much faster.

## How to use it
1. Go to Route 117 (if you're playing R/S/E) or Four Island in the Sevii Islands (if you're playing FR/LG).
2. Start the bot.

The bot will automatically check the old man for eggs, ride back and forth to hatch them, and manage your PC box.
