# 💊 EV Train

This mode automatically fights wild Pokémon to EV train your lead Pokémon.

The bot tracks the EVs for your lead Pokémon and will automatically run back to the nearest Pokémon Center to heal if your team gets low on HP. It's completely hands-off.

## What about Shinies?
If the bot runs into a shiny or something that matches your custom filters, it will stop fighting. It'll either catch it for you (if you have auto-catch on) or stop the bot so you can take over. You won't miss out on any shinies while training.

## How to use it
1. Stand in a patch of tall grass on one of the supported routes (see the list below).
2. Make sure you can walk directly from that spot to a Pokémon Center without going into any other buildings (like caves or tunnels).
3. Start the bot and select **EV Train** mode.
4. Enter the EV numbers you want in the window that pops up.

If the mode isn't available to select, it just means that specific route isn't supported yet.
