# 🎣 Fishing

This mode lets the bot fish for you. Many rare Pokémon can only be found with a fishing rod.

## Tips for better fishing
- **Sticky Hold / Suction Cups**: Put a Pokémon with one of these abilities in your first slot (it's fine if it's fainted). This will make Pokémon bite much more often.
- **Set it up**: Face the water, register a fishing rod to your `Select` button, and start the mode.

## Safari Zone Strategy
If you're fishing in the Safari Zone, the bot uses a special strategy based on research to maximize your catch rate.

- **Hoenn (R/S/E)**: The bot will use your Pokéblock case if you have one to help calm the Pokémon down before throwing balls.
- **Kanto (FR/LG)**: The bot will use the most effective bait and ball sequence based on how many Safari Balls you have left. 

**Note**: To make sure you don't run out of balls while on a hunt, the bot will stop and switch to manual mode if you have fewer than **15 Safari Balls** left.
