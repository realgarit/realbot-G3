# 🎰 Game Corner

This mode automatically buys Pokémon from the Celadon Game Corner and soft resets until it finds a shiny.

## How to use it
1. Make sure you have enough coins to buy at least one of the Pokémon you want.
2. Stand right in front of the NPC who sells the Pokémon.
3. **Save your game** (use the in-game save menu, not a save state).
4. Start the bot and select **Game Corner** mode.
5. Choose which Pokémon you want to hunt from the menu.

The bot will buy as many as it can, check them for shininess, and then soft reset if none of them are shiny.
