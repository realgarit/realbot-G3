# 🎨 Kecleon

This mode helps you hunt for a shiny Kecleon by using the "self-destruct" method. 

It works on the invisible Kecleon just outside Fortree City on Route 119. The bot will trigger the encounter and then use a move to knock your own Pokémon out. This fails the battle but keeps the Kecleon there so you can try again much faster than soft-resetting.

## Requirements
- **Emerald only**: This trick doesn't work in Ruby or Sapphire because the Kecleon disappears after the battle. If you're playing those games, use [Static Soft Resets](Mode%20-%20Static%20Soft%20Resets.md) instead.
- You must have the **Devon Scope**.
- Have only **one Pokémon** in your party, and it must know **Self-Destruct** or **Explosion**.
- You must not have caught or defeated this specific Kecleon yet.
- Make sure Fortree City was the last Pokémon Center you visited.

## How to use it
1. Stand right in front of the invisible Kecleon on Route 119.
2. Register your bike to the `Select` button (this makes the run back faster).
3. Start the bot.

The bot will trigger the encounter, use Self-Destruct to end the fight, and then ride back to the Fortree City Pokémon Center to heal and try again.
