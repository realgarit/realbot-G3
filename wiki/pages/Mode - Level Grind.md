# 🔄️ Level Grind

This mode automatically fights wild Pokémon to level up your team.

You can choose to focus only on your lead Pokémon or level up your entire party. If you pick your whole team, the bot will always send out your lowest-level Pokémon to battle and swap them as they grow.

The bot is completely hands-off. It will automatically walk back to the nearest Pokémon Center to heal when your party gets low on HP.

## What about Shinies?
The bot will never accidentally knock out a shiny. If it finds one (or something that matches your custom filters), it will either catch it automatically or stop the bot so you can take over.

## How to use it
1. Stand in a patch of tall grass on a supported route (see the list below).
2. Make sure you can walk directly from that spot to a Pokémon Center without going into any other buildings.
3. Start the bot and select **Level Grind** mode.

If the mode isn't available, it means that specific route isn't supported yet.
