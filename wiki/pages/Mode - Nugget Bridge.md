# 🟡 Nugget Bridge

This mode takes advantage of a glitch in the Kanto games to get infinite Nuggets. 

Basically, the Rocket member at the end of the bridge will give you a Nugget every time you talk to him, as long as you haven't defeated him yet. The bot will talk to him, get the Nugget, lose the battle on purpose, and then run back to do it all over again.

## Requirements
- You must have defeated the other trainers on Nugget Bridge, but **not** the Rocket member at the end.
- Have only **one Pokémon** in your party.
- Your Pokémon should be a **very low level** (level 6 or lower) so you lose the battle quickly. You can catch one on Route 4.

## How to use it
1. Stand either on Nugget Bridge or right outside the Cerulean City Pokémon Center.
2. Start the bot and pick **Nugget Bridge** mode.
3. Watch the Nuggets pile up!

**Note**: Since you lose every battle, you will lose some of your in-game money. But since each Nugget sells for ₽5,000, you'll still make a huge profit.
