# 🏃 Roamer Resets

This mode helps you hunt for shiny roaming Pokémon (like Latios, Latias, Entei, or Raikou). These Pokémon have their stats and shininess determined the moment you finish a specific cutscene, so you have to save *before* that cutscene and soft reset after checking them.

## General Tips
- **Lead Pokémon**: Put a Pokémon between level 5 and 40 (for R/S/E) or 5 and 50 (for FR/LG) in your first slot. This lets you use Repels to filter out everything except the roamer.
- **Abilities**: If your lead Pokémon has **Illuminate** or **Arena Trap**, you'll find them about 18% faster.
- **Stock Up**: Bring lots of Repels (at least 50-100). The bot will soft-reset if you run out, but it's much faster if you have enough to keep going for a while.
- **Fly**: Make sure someone in your party knows **Fly**.

## Emerald (Latios/Latias)
You need to set this up **before you beat the Champion**.
1. Beat the Elite Four and the Champion.
2. The game will send you back to your house in Littleroot Town.
3. **Stop!** Do not leave the upstairs room of your house.
4. Put your level 14–40 Pokémon in the lead.
5. **Save your game** (in-game, not a save state).
6. Start the bot.

The bot will leave the room, watch the TV cutscene, and then fly around to find the roamer.

## FireRed/LeafGreen (Entei/Raikou/Suicune)
You'll need the Ruby and Sapphire items for this. 
1. Get the Sapphire from the Sevii Islands.
2. Go to the **Net Center** on One Island.
3. Stand on the **left side** of Celio (the guy in front of the big machine).
4. **Stop!** Do not talk to him or give him the Sapphire yet.
5. Put your level 5–50 Pokémon in the lead.
6. **Save your game** (in-game, not a save state).
7. Start the bot.

The bot will give the Sapphire to Celio, which triggers the roamer, and then go find it.

## Ruby/Sapphire (Latios/Latias)
This is similar to Emerald but a bit more flexible.
1. Beat the Elite Four and return home.
2. Go downstairs and watch the cutscene with Norman.
3. **Stop!** The TV will be flashing, but don't interact with it yet.
4. Put your level 14–40 Pokémon in the lead.
5. **Save your game** right in front of the TV.
6. Start the bot.

The bot will talk to the TV to trigger the roamer and then start the search.
