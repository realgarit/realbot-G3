# 🗿 Rock Smash

This mode automatically smashes rocks to find rare Pokémon like Nosepass (in Granite Cave) and Shuckle (in the Safari Zone).

---

## Granite Cave (Nosepass)

You can hunt either with or without Repels. Using Repels is much faster because it filters out the low-level Pokémon you don't want.

### How to get the best odds
To get the most Nosepass encounters, you should use the **Repel Trick**:
1. **White Flute**: Having this in your bag can boost your encounters by **40%**.
2. **Abilities**: Put a Pokémon with **Vital Spirit** or **Pressure** (like Vigoroth) in your first slot.
3. **The Level Trick**: Repel works based on your first *non-fainted* Pokémon. Put a level 13 Pokémon in your second slot, and make sure your lead Pokémon (with the special ability) is fainted. This gives you the absolute best rates.

### How to use it
- **With Repel**: Have at least a few dozen Max Repels, save your game on B2F of Granite Cave, and start the bot. Pick "Use Repel" in the menu.
- **Without Repel**: Just stand on B2F and start the bot.

## Safari Zone (Shuckle)

*This is for Emerald only.*

The bot will pay the entrance fee, run to the rocks, smash them, and then leave when your time is up. It will use all your money on entrance fees and then soft reset to get your money back and start over.

### How to use it
1. Stand at the entrance to the Safari Zone.
2. Make sure you have some cash.
3. (Optional) Register your Mach Bike to the `Select` button to make the run faster.
4. **Save your game** (in-game, not a save state).
5. Start the bot.
