# 🏞️ Safari Mode

This mode makes hunting in the Safari Zone easy. You pick a Pokémon you want to find, and the bot will navigate to the right area and start hunting using the best method (spinning, surfing, or fishing).

## How to use it

1. **Save your game** at the Safari Zone entrance (Route 121 for R/S/E, or Fuchsia City for FR/LG).
2. Make sure you have at least ₽500.
3. Start the bot and pick **Safari Mode**.
4. Choose the Pokémon you want to hunt from the list.

### Extra Options
- **Pokéblock Feeder (R/S/E)**: If you have at least two Pokéblocks of the same flavor, you can tell the bot to use them in a feeder. This helps attract specific Pokémon.
- **Repels**: You can choose to use Repels during the hunt. This is great for getting to far-off areas without running into common Pokémon along the way.

## Catch Strategy

The bot doesn't just throw balls randomly. It uses researchers' "optimal catch patterns" to give you the best chance of catching your target.

- **In Hoenn (R/S/E)**: The bot will use your Pokéblocks (if you have them) to help calm the Pokémon before throwing balls.
- **In Kanto (FR/LG)**: The bot calculates the best move (Bait, Mud, or Ball) based on the Pokémon and how many Safari Balls you have left.

### Managing Your Cash
The bot will keep track of how much money you've spent. After about 30 runs (around ₽15,000), it will soft reset to get your money back and start over. 

If you actually caught your target Pokémon during those runs, the bot will stop and switch to manual mode so you can save your game before it resets.
