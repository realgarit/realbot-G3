# 🔄 Spin Mode

This mode makes the bot spin in a clockwise circle on a single tile. 

It's perfect for hunting in the Safari Zone or using the [repel trick](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Repel_trick). Because spinning doesn't count as taking steps, your Safari time won't run out and your Repels will last forever.

## How to use it
1. Go to a patch of grass, water, or a cave where you want to hunt.
2. Start the bot and pick **Spin** mode.

## Safari Zone Strategy
If you're hunting in the Safari Zone, the bot uses a smart strategy to catch Pokémon.

- **Hoenn (R/S/E)**: The bot uses a specific sequence of Pokéblocks and balls to give you the best catch rate.
- **Kanto (FR/LG)**: The bot decides when to use bait, mud, or a ball based on the Pokémon you find and how many balls you have left. 

**Note**: To make sure you don't run out of balls on a shiny, the bot will stop and switch to manual mode if you have fewer than **15 Safari Balls** left.
