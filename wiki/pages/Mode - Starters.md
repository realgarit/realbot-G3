# 💼 Starters

This mode automatically soft resets to find a shiny starter Pokémon.

The bot is smart about how it resets. It tracks the game's internal timer (RNG) to make sure you're hitting a different "frame" every time. This prevents you from seeing the exact same Pokémon over and over. Because of this, resets will get slightly longer the more you do them.

**Tip**: If resets are taking too long, you might want to start a new save to change your Trainer ID, or check out the `random_soft_reset_rng` option in [Cheats](Configuration%20-%20Cheats.md).

## How to use it

### Kanto (FireRed/LeafGreen)
1. Stand in Oak's lab, facing the Poké Ball of the starter you want.
2. **Save your game** (in-game, not a save state).
3. Start the bot, pick **Starters** mode, and choose your Pokémon.

### Hoenn (R/S/E)
1. Go to Route 101 and stand right in front of Birch's bag.
2. **Save your game** (in-game, not a save state).
3. Start the bot, pick **Starters** mode, and choose your Pokémon.

### Johto Starters (Emerald Only)
1. Stand in Birch's lab, facing the Poké Ball of the starter you want.
2. **Save your game** (in-game, not a save state).
3. Start the bot, pick **Starters** mode, and choose your Pokémon.

*Note: For Johto starters, the bot uses a special "cheat" to check for shininess instantly because navigating the menu is still being worked on.*
