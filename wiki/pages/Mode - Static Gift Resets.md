# 🎁 Static Gift Resets

This mode handles soft-resetting for Pokémon that are given to you as a gift, rather than being caught in a battle. This includes things like fossils, eggs, and gift NPCs.

## How to use it
In general, for all of these:
1. Face the person or item that gives you the Pokémon.
2. **Save your game** (in-game, not a save state).
3. Start the bot and pick **Static Gift Resets** mode.

## FireRed and LeafGreen

- **Fossils (Omanyte, Kabuto, Aerodactyl)**: Give your fossil to the scientist in Cinnabar Lab, leave the room, come back, and save in front of him.
- **Eevee**: Stand in front of the Poké Ball in the Celadon Mansion (top floor).
- **Hitmonlee/Hitmonchan**: Stand in front of the Poké Ball in the Fighting Dojo.
- **Lapras**: Stand in front of the NPC in Silph Co.
- **Magikarp**: Stand in front of the salesman in the Route 4 Pokémon Center. (Make sure you have ₽500!)
- **Togepi Egg**: Stand in front of the Old Man on Five Island. Your lead Pokémon must have max friendship.

## Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald

- **Castform**: This one is tricky. You must save *before* fighting Team Aqua at the Weather Institute. **Important**: Fill up your entire party and every single box in your PC first. This prevents the game from forcing the Castform on you immediately. Once the fight is over, you can save in front of the scientist and reset normally.
- **Beldum**: After beating the Elite Four, stand in front of the Poké Ball in Steven's house in Mossdeep City.
- **Fossils (Lileep, Anorith)**: Give the fossil to the scientist on the first floor of Devon Corp, leave the room, come back, and save in front of him.
- **Wynaut Egg**: Stand in front of the old lady in Lavaridge Town. Register your bike to `Select`. It's highly recommended to have a Pokémon with Flame Body or Magma Armor in your party to hatch it faster.
