# 🏃🏼 Static Run Aways

This mode is for hunting legendary Pokémon that respawn if you run away and then leave and re-enter the room. It's usually faster than soft-resetting because you don't have to wait for the game to reboot.

**Important**: Make sure you set `pickup: false` in your `battle.yml` before using this, or the bot might get confused.

## How to use it
For most of these, just stand directly in front of the legendary Pokémon and start the bot.

- **Lugia & Ho-Oh**: Stand in front of them at Navel Rock.
- **The Regi Trio**: Stand in front of Regice (Island Cave), Regirock (Desert Ruins), or Registeel (Ancient Tomb).
- **Kyogre & Groudon**: Stand on the platform in front of them in Marine Cave or Terra Cave.
- **Rayquaza**: Stand at the very top of Sky Pillar facing it.
- **Latias & Latios (Southern Island)**: Use the Eon Ticket to get to Southern Island. Place your character in the encounter grass and start the bot.
- **Mew**: Go to Faraway Island. Stand on the **left** tile just outside the forest area and start the bot.
