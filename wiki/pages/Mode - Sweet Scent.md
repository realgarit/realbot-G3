# 🔄 Sweet Scent

This mode uses the move **Sweet Scent** to immediately trigger a wild encounter. 

It's one of the fastest ways to hunt because you don't have to spend any time walking or spinning around. It also doesn't count as taking steps, so it's perfect for the Safari Zone.

## How to use it
1. Make sure one of the Pokémon in your party knows **Sweet Scent**.
2. Stand in a patch of grass, on the water, or in a cave.
3. Start the bot and pick **Sweet Scent** mode.

## Safari Zone Strategy
If you use this mode in the Safari Zone, the bot will use its specialized catch strategy to make sure you have the best chance of catching your target. See the [Safari Mode](Mode%20-%20Safari.md) page for more details on how this works.
