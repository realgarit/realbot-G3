# ⚡ Battle Transitions

The little animation that plays before a fight starts actually takes up a lot of time. If you're trying to get the absolute most encounters per hour, you should pay attention to which animation is playing.

The game picks a transition based on where you are and the level of your lead Pokémon compared to the wild one.

## How to save time
In many cases, if your lead Pokémon is a lower level than the wild one, the animation plays faster. This is why many hunters use a fast, low-level Pokémon in their first slot.

Here's how many frames each transition takes:

| Scenario | Time (Frames) |
|----------|---------------|
| Overworld/Fishing (Wild Pokémon is lower level) | **88** |
| Overworld/Fishing (Wild Pokémon is same/higher level) | **152** |
| Surfing/Diving (Wild Pokémon is lower level) | **85** |
| Surfing/Diving (Wild Pokémon is same/higher level) | **145** |
| Caves (Wild Pokémon is lower level) | **123** |
| Caves (Wild Pokémon is same/higher level) | **106** |

**Note**: In caves, it's actually faster if the wild Pokémon is a higher level. In most other places, you want a low-level lead Pokémon.
