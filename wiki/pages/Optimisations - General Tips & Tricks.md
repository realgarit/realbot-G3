# 💡 General Tips & Tricks

If you're shiny hunting for a long time, even saving a few seconds per encounter adds up to hours of saved time. Here are some simple ways to speed things up:

- **Game Settings**: Set your **Text Speed** to **Fast** and turn **Battle Scene** to **Off** in the game menu.
- **Lead Pokémon**:
    - Don't use a shiny Pokémon in your first slot. The shiny animation at the start of every battle wastes time.
    - Give your lead Pokémon a very short nickname (like a single letter).
    - Use a Pokémon with a short "cry" (like Lotad).
    - Use the **Illuminate** ability to double your encounter rate.
- **Save Your Repels**: If you use [Spin](Mode%20-%20Spin.md) or [Bunny Hop](Mode%20-%20Acro%20Bike%20Bunny%20Hop.md) modes, your Repels will last forever because the bot isn't actually taking steps. This also works to stay in the Safari Zone indefinitely.
- **Repel Trick**: Use the [Repel Trick](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Appendix:Repel_trick) to target specific, higher-level Pokémon and ignore the common low-level spawns.
- **Skip the Text**: Try not to use a Smoke Ball or the "Run Away" ability unless you really need to. They add extra text at the end of every battle which slows you down.
