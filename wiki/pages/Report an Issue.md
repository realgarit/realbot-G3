# 🆘 Reporting an Issue

If you're having trouble with the bot, here's how to let us know so we can help you fix it quickly.

## Before You Report
- **Read the Wiki**: Double-check the wiki page for the bot mode or setting you're using. Most issues can be solved just by following the steps exactly.

## What to Include in Your Report
If it's still not working, please give us these details:

1. **Error Screenshot**: A picture of the error message in the console/terminal window.
2. **Config Screenshot**: A picture of your config file (`.yml`). 
   - *Important*: If you're showing your Discord config, **hide your Webhook URL** so others don't see it!
3. **Folder Screenshot**: A picture of your `./profiles/<profile_name>/` folder so we can see where your files are.
4. **Description**: Tell us what you *wanted* the bot to do, and what it's *actually* doing. If you can record a quick video, that helps a lot!

## A Note on Patience
The people helping out on Discord are volunteers doing this in their free time. They're in different time zones, so it might take a little while to get a response.

## Example Reports

### ❌ A Bad Report
"My bot isn't working, please help."
(We don't know what you've tried or what your settings look like, so we can't help yet!)

### ✅ A Good Report
"I'm trying to set up Discord notifications but I'm getting an error. Here are my config and folder screenshots."
(With this info, we can usually spot the problem—like a typo in your config—in just a few minutes.)
