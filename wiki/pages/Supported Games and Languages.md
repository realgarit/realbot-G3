# 🌍 Supported Games and Languages

> **🚨 Important**: Do not ask for or share ROM files in our Discord. You will be banned immediately.

Supporting 48 different game versions across multiple languages is a huge task. Because of this, some languages or versions might not work perfectly yet.

We **highly recommend using English ROMs** for now. We prioritize English during development, though we're working on supporting all languages over time.

## Support Status
When you see tables on other wiki pages, here's what the icons mean:
- ✅ **Tested**: Works perfectly.
- 🟨 **Untested**: Might work, but we haven't confirmed it yet.
- ❌ **Not Working**: We know this doesn't work right now.
- 🚫 **Patched**: This feature was removed or fixed in this specific game version.

## 🛠️ ROM Hacks
The bot is designed to work with official Pokémon games only. **ROM hacks are not supported.** Please don't ask for help if your ROM hack doesn't work.

If you are an advanced user and want to try forcing the bot to run a ROM hack, check out the [Using Unsupported ROMs](Using%20Unsupported%20ROMs.md) page.

## ✅ Verified ROMs
The bot checks your ROMs against a list of official game "hashes" to make sure they're genuine. Here is a list of the versions the bot currently accepts:
